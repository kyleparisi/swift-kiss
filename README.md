# swift-kiss


I have switched over to a regular xcode project.  There is too much stuff that the editor does.
This particular app is a crappy text editor.  I used all kinds of references in this experiment.

Essentially you have to make object files (.o) for every `.swift` file and then link them together
using something like `ld`.  If you install dependencies, you have to the same for all their swift files.
This is actually typical C stuff but I know none of it.
